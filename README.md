# VictoryRoad

Pokemmon Victory roads is a passion project of mine. It's meant to take one of my all time favorite series from childhood Pokemon and combine it with my favorite genre of games Rougelikes.
The goal of this is to create a more challenging Pokemon experience and try and capture the feeling of really training your pokemon to face any challenge that comes your way. The reason as to why
I chose victory road is that I felt in the games, Victory Road a hyped up section of the game that's gated until the player gets 8 badges isn't really that challenging nor doesn't really live up 
to the "awe" and "challenge" that it is sometimes. So I took the inspiration from Roguelikes to improve this. What if Victory Road's path changed every single time the trainer stepped foot in it?
Different pokemon available to the player every time so that the player has to adapt to the tools given to them instead of targeting specific pokemon in the region to get on their team. Different 
trainers and Challenges every time. This is how I came up with VictoryRoads, to capture the "magic" of a challenging task presented to the player to get through with the pokemon they have.
